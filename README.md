# Geant4 Simulation: Proton Collision and Energy Deposition


This is a Geant4-based simulation program that models the collision of two protons in a detector and tracks the energy deposition in a sensitive volume. The program is designed for educational purposes and can be extended for more complex simulations.




## Dependencies
- **Geant4**: Version 10.7 or higher (with multithreading support enabled).
- **CMake**: Version 3.12 or higher.


## Build Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yousif-Elfeky/P_Pcollisions
   cd P_Pcollisions
   ```
2. **Create a Build Directory**:
     ```bash
     mkdir build
     cd build
     ```
3. **Build the Program**:
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    make
    ```
4. **Running the Simulation**:
    ```bash
    ./sim
    ```
## Credits
This program was developed with the help of tutorials and resources from **Physics Matters** on YouTube. Special thanks to the creator of the channel for providing clear and concise explanations of Geant4 concepts.
